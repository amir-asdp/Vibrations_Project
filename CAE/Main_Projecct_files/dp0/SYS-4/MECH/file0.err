 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.391   TIME= 15:10:52
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.391   TIME= 15:10:52
 Material number 10 (used by element 502) should normally have at least  
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.391   TIME= 15:10:52
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.391   TIME= 15:10:52
 Certain contact elements (for example 689 & 659) overlap with other.    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.875   TIME= 15:10:54
 Fewer modes than the requested number of modes ( 200 ) were computed.   
 The range specified (FREQB= 0, FREQE= 30) contains only 2 modes.        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.906   TIME= 15:10:54
 Material number 10 (used by element 502) should normally have at least  
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.156   TIME= 15:10:54
 To avoid duplication when using the LVSCALE command, delete all loads   
 unless already deleted.
