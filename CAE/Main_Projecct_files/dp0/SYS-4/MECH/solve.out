 *WARNING*: Some MPC/Lagrange based elements (e.g.530) in real constant  
 set 4 overlap with other MPC/Lagrange based elements (e.g.665) in real  
 constant set 8 which can cause overconstraint.

 Smoothing on certain contact nodes (e.g.196) for pair ID 4 may have     
 accuracy issue.  Please verify element normal of connected contact      
 elements (e.g.510 & 613).

 Force-distributed-surface identified by real constant set 4 and         
 contact element type 4 has been set up.  The pilot node 1298 is used    
 to apply the force.  Internal MPC will be built.

 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver used by the Block Lanczos          
 eigensolver is currently running in the in-core memory mode.  This      
 memory mode uses the most amount of memory in order to avoid using the  
 hard drive as much as possible, which most often results in the         
 fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended if enough physical     
 memory is present to accommodate all of the solver data.                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.875   TIME= 15:10:54
 Fewer modes than the requested number of modes ( 200 ) were computed.

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).
